# Credit_Risk_Analysis

### Overview
We are helping Jill with a new project in the credit card risk department. We are using imbalanced-learn along with scikit-learn libraries to get the job done. By using the dataset we were provided from LendingClub, we will oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms. We will then undersample the data with ClusterCentroids, use a combinational approach of over and undersampling using SMOTEENN, and compare the two machine learning models using BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to predict the credit risk. 

### Results

#### Naive Random Oversampling
#### SMOTE Oversampling
#### Undersampling
#### Combination Under-Over Sampling
#### Balanced Random Forest Classifier
#### Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier


### Summary
As you can see above, using different machine learning models we are able to see different types of balanced accuracies, precisions and recall numbers. Overall, I think in this situation we are going for a
